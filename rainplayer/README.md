## About The Project

![Video Player](./static/video-player.png)

This is a custom video player for the web built only with html, css and javascript.

The idea of creating this video player is to have an interface that looks the same in most browsers, removing the native players from each browser.

The main functionalities are:

- play video
- pause video
- go back 10 seconds
- fast forward 10 seconds
- audio manipulation
- mute
- video progress manipulation
- full screen

## Supported browsers

Currently this video player is compatible and functional in the following browsers:

- Chrome version 92
- Safari version 14
- Firefox 91

Browsers such as Microsoft Edge or Opera are outside the scope of this development, so some functionalities may not work properly.
